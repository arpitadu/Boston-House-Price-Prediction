# Boston-House-Price-Prediction
'Boston house price prediction' project is designed to forecast the median values of houses in Boston by taking into account multiple factors, including the area's crime rate, the ages of the homeowners, the number of businesses, and much more.

**Background:**

Boston, Massachusetts, is a dynamic metropolitan area characterized by its diverse population, socioeconomic diversity, environmental factors, and varied housing structuresâ€”all of which significantly influence housing prices. Understanding these factors and predicting housing price trends is crucial for real estate companies, policymakers, investors and homebuyers alike. The housing market in this dynamic region is complex and often time-consuming to navigate, shaped by a multitude of variables that impact market dynamics and investment strategies. 

In this current data era, house prices can be predicted accurately by leveraging data-driven analytical and machine-learning approaches. Therefore, this project aimed to estimate the median prices of owner-occupied homes in Boston by taking into account influencing socio-economic and environmental factors.
